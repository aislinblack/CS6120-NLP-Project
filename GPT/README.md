GPT Impementation on CovQuA 


This section contains the code and the predicted output data to run and evaluate the GPT model for COVID Question Answering.

We did make a Dialogue Answering GPT model to first test the model and  understand in depth how GPT model gets trained over a data set using the open ai libraries. 

Using this concept we applied it over the Covid dataset in the main program GPT.ipynb (run the avove files prefereably on Google Collab or equivalent online environment for added computational power)

This gives us the idea of the perplexity of the GPT model , so that we can decide the correct usage of the GPT in comparison with Albert and Bert model.

Also the GPTPrediction.pkl file give us the output of the GPT file that consist the answers that GPT could have given for the question asked 

Also inorder to evaluate the model we did find  the F1 Score , Recall , Precision , Perplexity , albation study such as by using word cloud and histograms we 
studied in three-  levels 1)Data Set 2) Question/Answer Length Type 3)Data preprocessing and Hyper parameter tuning
