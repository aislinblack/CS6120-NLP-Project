This was a preliminary implementation of the ALBERT model produced based on this https://colab.research.google.com/github/spark-ming/albert-qa-demo/blob/master/Question_Answering_with_ALBERT.ipynb#scrollTo=1qfQAtRsMVl7 tutorial. The code has been left because it still achieved the task, but ended up being deprecated to better fit with how the BERT model was built.
